> [!IMPORTANT]
> A modernized QtScript ditching JSC in favor of QuickJS-NG is work-in-progress in the following branch https://github.com/JulienMaille/qtscript-qt6/tree/quickjs-modernize

> [!NOTE]
> Looking for a compatible port of [qtscriptgenerator](https://github.com/JulienMaille/qtscriptgenerator-qt6)?

This repository provides the patches needed to build the QtScript core
module and the ScriptTools debugger module with Qt 6 on Windows x64/MSVC,
Linux x64/GCC, and universal macOS/Apple Clang. Qt 6.8 LTS (6.8.3) is the
baseline. CI also covers the latest 6.11.x on all three platforms.

QtScript source is not vendored. The build script clones KDE's QtScript
5.15.19 revision, copies the Qt 6 CMake entry point from [`cmake`](cmake),
and applies the ordered files in [`patches`](patches).

## Status

- Builds Debug and Release variants of `Qt6::Script` and `Qt6::ScriptTools`.
- Installs alongside the other Qt modules, like the Qt 5 module did.
- Preserves the public `QScript*` source API. Qt 5 binary compatibility is not
  supported.
- Ports the ScriptTools debugger (`QScriptEngineDebugger`, script/console/
  breakpoint widgets, completion and error reporting) with its
  `scripttools_debugging` resources.
- Does not depend on Core5Compat.
- Passes ~20 checks in the external CMake smoke test: evaluation, calls,
  exceptions, `QVariant`, `QRegExp` compatibility, and QObject exposure with
  enum conversion and signals. See
  [`docs/VALIDATION.md`](docs/VALIDATION.md) for full results.
- CI builds the ported upstream suites on every matrix job and executes
  them via a dedicated `ctest` step on each Debug job.
- Fixes the inherited QtScript `INT32_MIN` negation bug tracked as `QTBUG-32829`.

Legacy `QRegExp` signatures use `QtScript/QRegExp`, implemented with Qt 6
`QRegularExpression`. Regular-expression, wildcard, fixed-string, capture, and
replacement behaviors are supported. This compatibility API is compiled in by
default and can be disabled with `-DSCRIPT_QREGEXP=OFF`.

See [`docs/PORTING.md`](docs/PORTING.md) for the patch inventory.

> This port was developed with AI assistance under human planning and review,
with every change verified by continuous integration.

## Requirements

- CMake 3.16 or newer; qmake is not supported.
- Windows: Visual Studio 2022 or newer with the MSVC x64 C++ toolchain
  (CMake auto-detects the newest installed; CI exercises MSVC 2022 on the
  LTS leg and MSVC 2026 on the latest-Qt leg).
- Linux: GCC (C++17) and Ninja.
- macOS: Apple Clang and Ninja. The Qt installation determines the output
  architectures; official universal Qt packages produce universal frameworks.
- A supported Qt 6.8 through Qt 6.11 installation with private module build tooling
  (`qt-cmake-private`, `qtpaths`).

## Build

On Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-windows.ps1 -QtRoot C:\Qt\6.8.3\msvc2022_64 -Configuration Release
```

On Linux:

```bash
./scripts/build-linux.sh --qt-root "$HOME/Qt/6.8.3/gcc_64" --configuration Release
```

On macOS, install into an isolated prefix:

```bash
bash ./scripts/build-macos.sh \
  --qt-root "$HOME/Qt/6.8.3/macos" \
  --install-prefix "$PWD/.work/qtscript-install" \
  --configuration Release
```

The script clones the 5.15.19 sources, applies the patch series, builds, and
installs both modules into the Qt prefix using the same layout the Qt 5
module used: headers under `include\QtScript` and `include\QtScriptTools`,
CMake packages under `lib\cmake\Qt6Script` and `lib\cmake\Qt6ScriptTools`, binaries in
`bin`/`lib`, and module registration under `mkspecs\modules`. It then runs an
out-of-tree CMake smoke build that compiles and runs against the installed
modules.

## Security

QtScript embeds a legacy 2011 JavaScriptCore snapshot. It is not a security
sandbox; run only trusted scripts. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## License

QtScript and patched source retain their upstream licenses. License texts are
included in [`LICENSES`](LICENSES).
