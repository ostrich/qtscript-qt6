# Porting notes

## Upstream source

- Repository: `https://invent.kde.org/qt/qt/qtscript.git`
- Release branch: `5.15.19`

The repository stores patches, not a snapshot of the upstream sources. The
Windows, Linux, and macOS scripts clone the QtScript release, copy the Qt 6 CMake
entry point from `cmake/`, apply the files in `patches/` in lexical order,
and optionally apply the selected test changes in `patches/optional/tests`
with `-IncludePortedTests`.

The scripts reuse an existing clean source directory that has already been
patched. Delete that directory under `.work/` before applying a changed patch
series.

## CMake entry point

`cmake/` mirrors the Qt 6 build files at their in-tree paths
(`CMakeLists.txt`, `.cmake.conf`, `src/CMakeLists.txt`,
`src/script/CMakeLists.txt`, and the files under `src/scripttools`) and is
copied verbatim by the apply scripts; it is not a patch. The module never depends on
QtCore5Compat. The legacy `QRegExp` compatibility API is compiled in by
default and can be disabled with `-DSCRIPT_QREGEXP=OFF`, which defines
`QT_NO_REGEXP` and drops the `QtScript/QRegExp` header.

## Default patch series

1. `0001-Remove-Core5Compat-dependency.patch` supplies the legacy public
   `QRegExp` API using `QRegularExpression`, preserves key Qt 5 regexp
   behavior, and removes the Core5Compat dependency; the shim and the
   `QT_NO_REGEXP` guards it relies on stay intact for the optional build.
2. `0002-Port-JavaScriptCore-subset-to-C-17.patch` contains the C++17/MSVC
   adaptations exercised by the CMake source manifest.
3. `0003-Adapt-QtScript-API-and-metatypes-to-Qt-6.patch` handles Qt 6 API,
   container, enum/metatype, atomic, and date/time differences.
4. `0004-Adapt-QObject-bridge-to-Qt-6.patch` contains the QObject, Qt 6
   metaobject, method invocation, property, and signal bridge changes.
5. `0005-Replace-removed-QBoolBlocker-helper.patch` replaces the removed
   private Qt helper with `QScopedValueRollback<bool>`.
6. `0006-Add-Linux-core-build-support.patch` selects the platform-specific
   JavaScriptCore stack allocator for Linux builds; the CMake source
   selection itself lives in the copied `cmake/` files.
7. `0007-Promote-INT32_MIN-negation-to-double-in-negate-opcode.patch` fixes
   `QTBUG-32829`: signed overflow when negating the smallest 32-bit integer.
8. `0008-Add-ScriptTools-debugger-module.patch` ports the ScriptTools
   debugger module to Qt 6: replaces the removed `QScopedSharedPointer` with
   a module-local equivalent (`qscopedsharedpointer_p.h`), drops
   forward-declared `QStringList` for the Qt 6 alias include, swaps
   `QSet::toList`/`QList::toSet` for range constructors, and replaces the
   removed `QRegExpValidator` with `QRegularExpressionValidator`.
9. `0009-Fix-JavaScriptCore-build-with-modern-macOS-libc.patch` removes an
   obsolete Darwin `ceil` workaround whose global macro rewrites declarations
   in modern libc++ headers and prevents JavaScriptCore from compiling.
10. `0010-Canonicalize-script-extension-search-paths.patch` keeps extension
    discovery relative when macOS resolves a library path through a symlink,
    such as `/tmp` to `/private/tmp`.

## Optional test layer

`patches/optional/tests` updates selected upstream tests and is applied with
`-IncludePortedTests`. The normal module build keeps `QT_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`.
The optional test layer is not required to compile or smoke-test the core
module.

## Build scope

The Qt 6 CMake entry point builds the `Script` module and the `ScriptTools`
debugger module (`Qt6::ScriptTools`, including the `QScriptEngineDebugger`
widget and the `scripttools_debugging` resources). It exports `Qt6::Script`
and `Qt6::ScriptTools`, their public/private headers, and CMake package
metadata. Examples, documentation, qmake integration, and platforms other
than Windows, Linux, and macOS are outside the acceptance scope. The official
universal macOS Qt packages produce universal QtScript frameworks.
